# Using DocStrings
{: .no_toc}

## Example Content

```text
├─ features
|   ├─ send_result_mail.feature
|   |         /* send calculation result as mail feature file */
├─ src
|   ├─ __step_definition__
|   |   ├─ the_steps.js
                /* step definition for the send as mail example */
```

## Why DocStrings

In the examples before we were passing standard strings inside the step as parameter.
If you want to specify larger content be used in emails or files, the possibility to  pass 
it in steps or data tables is not sufficient.

Large texts can be used with DocString. 

````gherkin
  Scenario: Save a Single Calculation Result to File

  Use a DocString within a step.

    Given Bernhard opened a calculator
    And he summed up the nummbers
      | number1 | number2 | result |
      | 1       | 3       | 4      |
    When he saves the calculation to a file
    Then he can see the file containing
    """
    I added the number 1 to number 3
    and got the result: 4
    """
````

DocStrings are enclosed in three quote ``"""`` character. The string will then be passed
as a normal parameter the the step definition.

````typescript
Then('he can see the file containing', function (docString) {
    console.log(docString)
});
````

## Exercise

1. Use a DocString to print a Tree to the console:

    The output should look like this:
    
    ````text
         *
       _/ \_
     _/     \_
    /___   ___\
        | |
    ````

2. Create a step where 
    1. data is passed in the step
    1. data is specified in data tables
    1. data is passed as a DocString
    
    Now create a step definition, printing all there data structures to the console.
