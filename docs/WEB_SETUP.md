## Manual installation by downloading the server and driver files

First download and extract the following files into a folder of your choice

1. [Selenium Standalone Server](https://selenium.dev/downloads/)
1. [gecko driver](https://github.com/mozilla/geckodriver/releases)
    * FOR WINDOWS USERS: download version 0.24 until the 
    [known bug](https://github.com/mozilla/geckodriver/issues/1617) is fixed
1. [chrome driver](https://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads)
    * Make sure the driver version matches your installed chrome browser version.

Your folder should now contain the following files:

````
├─ selenium-server-standalone.jar

├─ geckodriver.exe

````

> If you want to keep the version information on those files, change the start script accordingly

installation and later on the update process.

you can do ``Ctrl + c`` inside the window you started the server or

```bash
